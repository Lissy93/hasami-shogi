### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note
*I made this in 2015, and it was one of the first iOS apps I built using Swift. There is probably code examples of much more up-to-date board-game apps out there now, and so I would not reccomend using this as any kind of example.* üòâ

*But thank you for taking a look at it, and if you have any suggestions, raise an issue and I will (dust out my Apple Mac) and look into it* ‚ò∫Ô∏è
